"Sisyphus Algorithms" implemented in multiple languages of all kinds:
- programming
- speaking
- esoteric
- non-Turing-Complete
- and more!

## Why
Why not? What a better way to perpetuate Sisyphus ~~suffering~~ [happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus#Chapter_4:_The_Myth_of_Sisyphus) than to endlessly rewrite an algorithm in every imaginable language??!
